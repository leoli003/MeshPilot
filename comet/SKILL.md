# Comet — OpenSpec + Superpowers Dual-Star Development Workflow

OpenSpec and Superpowers orbit the same goal like a binary star system.

```
OpenSpec handles WHAT  — outline, proposal, spec lifecycle, archive
Superpowers handles HOW — technical design, planning, execution, closing
```

**Core principle: brainstorming cannot be skipped. Every change must undergo deep design (except hotfix and tweak presets).**

---

## Ralph Mode

When the `--ralph` flag is passed (e.g., `/comet --ralph <task description>`), Comet wraps its workflow inside Ralph's PRD-driven persistence loop:

**Detection:** Check if `{{PROMPT}}` contains `--ralph`. If present:
1. Strip `--ralph` from the working prompt
2. Create a PRD with the following user stories derived from Comet phases:
   - US-001: Open phase complete (proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md created and confirmed)
   - US-002: Design phase complete (Design Doc created and confirmed)
   - US-003: Build phase complete (implementation done, tasks.md all checked)
   - US-004: Verify phase complete (verification passed, branch handled)
   - US-005: **User requirement verified** (actual test/evidence that the original user requirement is satisfied)
   - US-006: Archive phase complete (change archived)
3. Execute the standard Ralph iteration loop (Steps 2-9 from Ralph SKILL.md)
4. Each story's acceptance criteria include the corresponding Comet phase exit conditions
5. **US-005 acceptance criteria MUST include concrete evidence that the user's original requirement is met** (e.g., for a bug fix: actual test showing the bug is fixed; for a feature: demonstration that the feature works as expected)
6. Run mandatory deslop pass after Step 7 approval (unless `--no-deslop` is specified)
7. Use `--critic` selection if provided (default: architect)

**Ralph Mode Flow:**
```
/comet --ralph <task>
  ↓ Strip --ralph, create PRD
  ↓ Ralph iteration loop
  ├── US-001: Open phase → verify → passes: true
  ├── US-002: Design phase → verify → passes: true
  ├── US-003: Build phase → verify → passes: true
  ├── US-004: Verify phase → verify → passes: true
  ├── US-005: User requirement verified → actual test/evidence → passes: true
  └── US-006: Archive phase → verify → passes: true
  ↓ All stories pass → architect/critic verification
  ↓ Deslop pass
  ↓ /oh-my-claudecode:cancel
```

**Ralph Mode Benefits:**
- Automatic retry on phase failures
- PRD-driven progress tracking
- Mandatory verification before completion
- **Mandatory user requirement verification (US-005) - not just process completion**
- Persistent state across iterations
- Clean completion with deslop pass

---

## Auto Mode

When the `--auto` flag is passed (e.g., `/comet --auto <task description>`), Comet skips all user confirmation prompts by automatically selecting the recommended/reasonable default option at each decision point.

**Detection:** Check if `{{PROMPT}}` contains `--auto`. If present:
1. Strip `--auto` from the working prompt
2. Proceed through all phases without asking for user confirmation
3. At each AskUserQuestion blocking point, automatically select the recommended option

**Auto Mode Decision Defaults:**

| Blocking Point | Auto Selection | Reason |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Open phase review | "确认，进入下一阶段" | Accept generated artifacts |
| Design phase confirmation | User's selected option or first recommended | Accept design proposal |
| Build: isolation selection | "创建分支" (branch) | Simple, fast, recommended for ≤3 files |
| Build: execution method | "subagent-driven-development" | Recommended for ≥3 tasks |
| Verify: branch handling | "合并到主分支" (merge to main) | Standard completion flow |
| Verify failure: fix or accept | "Fix all" | Continue to fix issues |

**Auto Mode + Ralph Mode:**
When both `--auto` and `--ralph` are used together (e.g., `/comet --ralph --auto <task>`):
- Ralph wraps the Comet workflow
- Auto mode applies within each Comet phase
- No user confirmation needed at any blocking point
- Fully autonomous execution from start to archive

**Auto Mode Flow:**
```
/comet --auto <task>
  ↓ Strip --auto
  ↓ Open phase → auto-confirm → proceed
  ↓ Design phase → auto-confirm → proceed
  ↓ Build phase → auto-select branch + subagent → execute
  ↓ Verify phase → auto-merge to main → proceed
  ↓ Archive phase → complete
```

**Auto Mode Benefits:**
- Fully autonomous execution
- No manual intervention required
- Faster completion for straightforward changes
- Ideal for CI/CD integration or batch processing

**Auto Mode Caveats:**
- Cannot rollback decisions mid-execution
- May select options that don't match user preference
- Use only when defaults are acceptable

## Decision Core

Agents need only read this section for decision-making. Refer to the Reference Appendix as needed.

### Automatic Phase Detection

**Step 0: Active Change Discovery and Intent Detection**

1. Detect presets first; if hotfix/tweak matches, invoke the corresponding preset skill directly and do not enter the normal open branch
2. When no preset matches, run `openspec list --json` to get all active changes

**Preset detection has highest priority**:
- User explicitly describes a bug fix / hotfix + meets hotfix conditions → directly invoke `/comet-hotfix`
- User explicitly describes copy/config/docs/prompt small adjustment + meets tweak conditions → directly invoke `/comet-tweak`
- No preset match → follow the table below

| Active changes | User input | Behavior |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| None | non-preset input | → Invoke `/comet-open` |
| Exactly 1 | `/comet <description>` | → **Ask**: continue this change or create a new change |
| Multiple | `/comet <description>` | → **Ask**: continue existing or create new; if continuing, list changes for selection |
| Exactly 1 | `/comet` with no description | → Auto-select, enter Step 1 |
| Multiple | `/comet` with no description | → List changes for user selection |

<IMPORTANT>
When the user chooses "create a new change", **must invoke `/comet-open`**. Do not call `/opsx:new` directly.
`/comet-open` performs dual initialization: OpenSpec artifacts (created by internal `/opsx:new`) plus `.comet.yaml` state file.
Calling `/opsx:new` directly leaves `.comet.yaml` missing and breaks later phase detection.
</IMPORTANT>

**Step 1: Read `.comet.yaml` state metadata**

Prefer reading `openspec/changes/<name>/.comet.yaml`. If not available, fall back to `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`, `tasks.md`, and `docs/superpowers/` file checks.

**Resume rules**:
- On every context resume, rerun Step 0 and Step 1; do not trust conversation history for phase detection
- If there is an active change and the worktree has uncommitted changes, handle them through `comet/reference/dirty-worktree.md`. That protocol defines checks, attribution, and prohibitions; this file does not repeat them
- If `phase: build`, first check `build_pause`, `plan`, `build_mode`, and `isolation`:
  - If `build_pause: plan-ready` and the plan file exists, return to the `/comet-build` plan-ready resume point, prompt the user to continue choosing isolation and execution method, and do not regenerate the plan
  - If `build_pause: plan-ready` but the plan file is missing, return to `/comet-build` to handle corrupted state or regenerate the plan
  - If `build_mode` or `isolation` is unset, return to the corresponding `/comet-build` step to supplement before executing
  - If both are set, read the next unchecked task from tasks.md and continue
- If `phase: verify` and `verify_result: fail`, enter the verification failure decision blocking point: pause and ask the user to fix or accept deviation; only after the user chooses fix, run `"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <name> verify-fail` and invoke `/comet-build`
- If `phase: open` but proposal/design/tasks are complete, first run `"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> open --apply` to repair state, then continue detection
- If `phase: archive`, only invoke `/comet-archive`; after archive succeeds, the change moves to the archive directory, so do not run guard against the old active directory

**Step 2: Phase Determination** (check in order, first match wins)

1. `archived: true` or change moved to archive → Workflow complete
2. `verify_result: pass` and `archived` is not `true` → Invoke `/comet-archive`
3. `verify_result: fail` → Enter verification failure decision blocking point (pause and ask fix or accept deviation; only after user chooses fix, run `verify-fail` then `/comet-build`)
4. `phase: verify` or tasks.md all checked → Invoke `/comet-verify`
5. `phase: build` or has Design Doc but plan/execution incomplete → Route by workflow: `hotfix` → `/comet-hotfix`, `tweak` → `/comet-tweak`, `full` → `/comet-build`
6. `phase: design` or has change but no Design Doc → Invoke `/comet-design`
7. `phase: open` or active change exists but `.comet.yaml` is missing → Invoke `/comet-open`
8. No active change → Invoke `/comet-open`

If metadata conflicts with file state, use verifiable file state as source of truth and correct `.comet.yaml` before continuing.

### Preset Upgrade Criteria

**hotfix → full** (upgrade if any condition met):
- Change involves **3+ files**
- Architecture changes (new modules, new interfaces, new dependencies)
- Database schema changes
- Fix introduces new public API
- Fix scope exceeds a single function/module

**tweak → full** (upgrade if any condition met):
- Change involves **5+ files**
- Cross-module coordination required
- **5+** new test cases needed
- Config item additions or deletions (not value changes)

### Error Handling Quick Reference

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| `openspec list --json` fails | Check if openspec is installed, prompt user to run `openspec init` |
| Sub-skill unavailable | Stop workflow, prompt to install or enable the corresponding skill |
| `.comet.yaml` malformed or missing | Use file state as source of truth, correct with `"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" set` then continue |
| Build/test fails | Return to build phase for fixes, do not enter verify |
| Incomplete change directory structure | Fill missing files according to `comet-open` artifact requirements |

### Phase Transitions

<IMPORTANT>
A single `/comet` invocation starts from the detected phase and advances to the next phase when exit conditions are met.

Flow chain: open → design → build → verify → archive

**Continuous execution requirement**: starting from the detected phase, the agent automatically continues through all later phases. But **auto-advancing only applies at transition points without user decisions**. When encountering user decision points, **must use the AskUserQuestion tool to pause and wait for the user's explicit response**. Must not use recommendation rules, defaults, or historical preferences to substitute for user confirmation, and must not just output a text prompt and then continue executing.

**Decision points are blocking points**: whenever reaching any of the following nodes, the current `/comet` invocation must stop, **using the AskUserQuestion tool to wait for the user's choice**. Only after the user explicitly chooses can the corresponding state fields be written and operations executed, then auto-advance resumes.

Nodes requiring user participation (pause only at these nodes):
1. Open phase proposal/design/tasks review and confirmation
2. Confirm design approach during brainstorming
3. Plan-ready pause choice during build phase, followed by workflow configuration selection (isolation + execution method)
4. Decide to fix or accept deviation when verify fails (including Spec drift handling)
5. Choose branch handling method for finishing-branch
6. Encounter upgrade conditions (hotfix/tweak → full workflow)
7. Build phase scope expansion requiring redesign or new change split

Agents should not skip these decision points; other unambiguous phase transitions must proceed automatically, must not exit midway. At decision points, **text output must NOT substitute for tool-based waiting — must explicitly obtain the user's choice via AskUserQuestion before continuing**.

**Red Flags** — when these thoughts appear, STOP and check:

| Agent Thought | Actual Risk |
|--------------|-------------|
| "The user would probably agree with this approach" | Cannot decide for the user — use AskUserQuestion |
| "This is a small change, confirmation isn't needed" | Decision points have no size exception — blocking points must wait |
| "The user chose A last time, so A again" | Historical preference cannot substitute for current confirmation |
| "I explained the plan and the user didn't object" | No objection ≠ consent — must use tool to get explicit choice |
| "The flow has reached this point, should be fine" | Verification not passed ≠ passed — check verify_result |
</IMPORTANT>

## Reference Appendix

### .comet.yaml Field Reference

```yaml
workflow: full
phase: build
design_doc: docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md
plan: docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md
base_ref: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
build_mode: subagent-driven-development
build_pause: null
isolation: branch
verify_mode: light
verify_result: pending
verification_report: null
branch_status: pending
created_at: 2026-05-26
verified_at: null
archived: false
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `workflow` | `full`, `hotfix`, or `tweak` |
| `phase` | Current phase: `open`, `design`, `build`, `verify`, `archive` (init sets to `open` uniformly, guard handles transitions) |
| `design_doc` | Associated Superpowers Design Doc path, can be empty |
| `plan` | Associated Superpowers Plan path, can be empty |
| `base_ref` | Git commit SHA recorded at init, used for scale assessment. Serves as fallback when no plan exists |
| `build_mode` | Selected execution method, can be empty |
| `build_pause` | Internal build-phase pause point. `null` means no pause; `plan-ready` means the plan has been generated and the user chose to pause for switching models |
| `isolation` | `branch` or `worktree`, workspace isolation method. Full workflow init may leave this as `null`, but only until `/comet-build` Step 3; hotfix/tweak default to `branch` |
| `verify_mode` | `light` or `full`, can be empty |
| `verify_result` | `pending`, `pass`, or `fail` |
| `verification_report` | Verification report file path; must point to an existing file before verify can pass |
| `branch_status` | `pending` or `handled`; set to `handled` after branch handling completes |
| `created_at` | Change creation date (auto-set at init), format `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `verified_at` | Verification pass time, can be empty |
| `archived` | Whether change is archived |

Optional fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `direct_override` | `true`/`false`. Full workflow may use `build_mode: direct` only when this is explicitly `true` |
| `build_command` | Project build command. Guard runs this first and prints failure output |
| `verify_command` | Project verification command. Verify guard runs this first; if absent, it falls back to the build command |

State-machine hard constraints:
- Before `build → verify`, `isolation` must be `branch` or `worktree`
- Before `build → verify`, `build_mode` must be selected
- `build_mode: direct` is allowed by default only for `hotfix` / `tweak`; full workflow requires `direct_override: true`
- `build_pause` is not an execution method and must not be written to `build_mode`
- These constraints are enforced by both `comet-guard.sh build --apply` and `comet-state.sh transition <name> build-complete`

### Script Location

Comet scripts are distributed in `comet/scripts/`. **Do not hardcode paths** — locate once, cache in env vars:

```bash
COMET_ENV="${COMET_ENV:-$(find . "$HOME"/.*/skills "$HOME/.config" "$HOME/.gemini" -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-env.sh' -type f -print -quit 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$COMET_ENV" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: comet-env.sh not found. Ensure the comet skill is installed." >&2
  return 1
fi
. "$COMET_ENV"

# Stop workflow when script location fails
if [ -z "$COMET_GUARD" ] || [ -z "$COMET_STATE" ] || [ -z "$COMET_HANDOFF" ] || [ -z "$COMET_ARCHIVE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Comet scripts not found. Ensure the comet skill is installed." >&2
  echo "Expected path pattern: */comet/scripts/comet-*.sh under project or platform skill directories" >&2
  return 1
fi
```

**Auto state update**: Guard supports `--apply` flag, automatically updating `.comet.yaml` state fields after checks pass:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_GUARD" <change-name> <phase> --apply
```

`--apply` delegates to `comet-state transition`. Use these semantic events when state changes need to be expressed directly:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> open-complete
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> design-complete
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> build-complete
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> verify-pass
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <change-name> verify-fail
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_STATE" transition <archive-name> archived
```

**Archive script**: Complete all archive steps in one command:

```bash
"$COMET_BASH" "$COMET_ARCHIVE" <change-name>
```

After loading comet, agents should run the variable assignments above once, then reuse `$COMET_GUARD`, `$COMET_STATE`, `$COMET_HANDOFF`, `$COMET_ARCHIVE` throughout the session.

### Best Practices

1. **brainstorming cannot be skipped** — Every change must undergo deep design (except hotfix and tweak)
2. **delta spec is a living document** — Freely modify during phase 3, sync at archive
3. **Handoff packages are generated by scripts** — OpenSpec → Superpowers context must be generated through `comet-handoff.sh` as compact traceable excerpts (use `--full` when needed), and validated by guard for source/hash/mode
4. **Keep tasks.md in sync** — Check off each completed task
5. **Commit frequently** — One commit per task, message reflects design intent
6. **Verify before archive** — Execute `/comet-archive` only after `/comet-verify` passes
7. **Classify incremental updates** — Small edits, medium brainstorming, large new changes
8. **Plan must associate with change** — File header contains `change:` and `design-doc:` metadata
9. **Archive closure** — design doc and plan must mark `archived-with` status
10. **Modifying existing features** — Just open a new change
11. **Preset has limits** — Switch to full workflow promptly when hotfix/tweak meet upgrade conditions
