# 头脑风暴：将想法转化为设计

通过自然的协作对话，帮助将想法转化为完整的设计和规格。

首先理解当前项目上下文，然后逐一提问来细化想法。一旦理解了要构建的内容，呈现设计并获得用户批准。

**语言要求：所有输出使用中文编写（标题、描述、设计说明等），技术术语可保留英文（如 AABB、requestAnimationFrame），代码、变量名、函数名保持英文不变。**

<HARD-GATE>
在呈现设计并获得用户批准之前，不要调用任何实现技能、编写任何代码、搭建任何项目或采取任何实现行动。这适用于所有项目，无论感知的简单程度如何。
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## 文件命名规范

**设计文档命名格式**：`序号-中文标题-设计.md`

示例：
- `0004-挡板碰撞粒子效果-设计.md`
- `0005-顶部墙壁碰撞粒子效果-设计.md`

**序号来源**：
1. 从 `.comet.yaml` 的 `sequence` 字段读取（由 comet-state.sh init 时分配）
2. 如果未设置，扫描 `docs/superpowers/specs/` 目录找到最大序号 +1

**中文标题来源**：
- 从 `.comet.yaml` 的 `chinese_title` 字段读取
- 或从 `proposal.md` 第一行提取（去掉 `# ` 前缀）

**保存位置**：`docs/superpowers/specs/序号-中文标题-设计.md`

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **探索项目上下文** — 检查文件、文档、最近提交
2. **提供可视化伴侣**（如果主题涉及可视化问题）— 独立消息，不与澄清问题混合
3. **提出澄清问题** — 一次一个问题，理解目的/约束/成功标准
4. **提出2-3种方案** — 包含权衡和推荐
5. **呈现设计** — 按复杂度分节，每节后获得用户批准
6. **编写设计文档** — 保存到 `docs/superpowers/specs/序号-中文标题-设计.md` 并提交
7. **规格自审** — 快速内联检查占位符、矛盾、歧义、范围
8. **用户审核书面规格** — 请求用户审核规格文件后再继续
9. **过渡到实现** — 调用 writing-plans 技能创建实现计划

    "User reviews spec?" -> "Write design doc" [label="changes requested"];

}
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/superpowers/specs/序号-中文标题-设计.md`
  - 序号从 `.comet.yaml` 的 `sequence` 字段读取
  - 中文标题从 `.comet.yaml` 的 `chinese_title` 字段或 `proposal.md` 第一行提取
  - (用户对规格位置的偏好覆盖此默认值)
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "规格已编写并提交到 `<path>`。请审核，如有需要修改请告知，然后我们开始编写实现计划。"

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you in a web browser. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. This feature is still new and can be token-intensive. Want to try it? (Requires opening a local URL)"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. The message should contain ONLY the offer above and nothing else. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
